# Network Packet Flow Statistics and Analysis

## Project Overview
This Python project leverages the power of Pandas for network packet flow statistics and analysis, coupled with Matplotlib for visualizing different types of packet data. The aim of the project is to provide a comprehensive tool for understanding and visualizing network packet flows.

## Features
Packet Flow Analysis:

### Collect and process network packet data for detailed analysis.
Extract key statistics, including packet types, source and destination addresses, and protocol information.
Visualization with Matplotlib:

### Utilize Matplotlib for creating insightful visualizations of network packet data.
Generate various plots, charts, and graphs to represent different aspects of packet flows.
Customizable Analysis:

### Filter and focus on specific aspects of packet flow data based on user-defined criteria.
Explore trends and patterns within the network traffic.
### Data Export: 
Export processed data and visualizations in different formats for further analysis or reporting.
### User-Friendly Interface:
Intuitive command-line or script-based interface for ease of use.
Interactive visualizations for dynamic exploration of network packet data.
